## Programming
This summer I started my way in programming with [a course at STEPIK.ORG from ITC](https://stepik.org/course/38218). Now I know HTML and CSS at a beginner level. The course I have taken has proven that I can learn new and complex information in a short time.
## Example of work
For now there is only an example from the course that I took. (gh-pages => Houston. Wikipedia.html)
## Work 
Previously, my job had nothing to do with programming: I worked as a cashier in a pizzeria, a steward in a stadium, a cloakroom attendant in a concert hall, and, in the end, almost a whole year as a teacher at school.
## Education
My studies was not previously associated with programming. In 2014-2019, I studied as a teacher-psychologist of deviant behavior at the Kuban State University, did an internship in a kindergarten, school, gymnasium, at state exams, children's camps (in Russia and Germany), in prison. I took various small courses during studies at the university and after it.

Now I'm actively studying Adobe Illustrator, using a graphics tablet, design. And I also have many other hobbies outside the field of programming.
## English language
My English language proficiency ranges from B1 Intermediate to B2 Upper Intermediate, in accordance with the guidelines set by the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR).
